# Terrain Visualization

This repository demonstrates how to generate both a **2D colored DEM with hillshade** and a **3D terrain visualization** for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, Pakistan. Using **Python**, **SRTM data**, and libraries like **Rasterio**, **GeoPandas**, and **Matplotlib**, we can highlight KP’s diverse elevations and rugged landscapes.

## Features

- **2D Hillshade Map**  
  A color‐coded DEM (Digital Elevation Model) blended with hillshade, providing a detailed top‐down view of KP’s topography.

- **3D Terrain Model**  
  A fully interactive 3D surface plot (in Python) that showcases elevation variations and mountainous regions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Rasterio  
- GeoPandas  
- Matplotlib  
- NumPy  
- srtm  
- shapely  

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.  
2. **Install the dependencies**  
3. **Run the provided Python script(s)** to generate both 2D and 3D maps. Adjust file paths, resolution, or other parameters as needed.  
4. **View the outputs** in your favorite image viewer or embed them in your reports/notebooks.

## Sample Outputs

Below are examples of the final visualizations produced by the script:
